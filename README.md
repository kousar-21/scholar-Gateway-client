# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.




# Project Name: ScholarGateway

# Project Purpose:

- The Scholarship Management System is a full-stack web application designed to streamline the process of discovering, applying for, and managing scholarships. This platform serves three key user roles: students, moderators, and administrators. Students can browse available scholarships, view detailed information, and apply through a guided application process. They can also track their application status, make payments if required, and submit reviews based on their experiences. Moderators are responsible for managing scholarship listings, reviewing student applications, and handling public reviews to maintain credibility. Administrators have full control over the platform, including user management, role assignment, and system-wide monitoring. This system simplifies communication between scholarship providers and applicants, offering a transparent, organized, and user-friendly experience for all stakeholders. The project is built using modern technologies including React, Tailwind CSS, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, making it scalable, responsive, and easy to maintain. Its goal is to create a centralized, accessible, and efficient system that empowers students while reducing manual work for scholarship administrators. With clearly separated user roles, real-time updates, secure authentication, and a modern UI/UX, this platform ensures a smooth and reliable scholarship management process from start to finish.
